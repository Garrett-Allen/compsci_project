# CS390 Final Project: Analysis of unstructured text data for online recipe classification.

Online recipe platforms offer an extensive repository of user-generated reviews and ratings that help consumers decide which recipe to cook and how to modify it to suit their preferences. We present a replication study of the 2019 paper "My Curiosity was Satisfied, but not in a Good Way": Predicting User Ratings for Online Recipes by Can Liu et al., which predicted recipe ratings using NLP techniques. Our study extends the original work by exploring various models, including Lasso Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Random Forest, with updated engines for sentiment classification and part of speech tagging, and using a new dataset from Food.com. Surprisingly, most models perform no better than the baseline, which simply predicts a 5-star rating. However, the Random Forest model shows potential with slightly lower accuracy but a lower root mean squared error. Our study contributes to the understanding of the strengths and limitations of various NLP techniques for predicting recipe ratings from user-generated reviews and offers directions for future research in this area.
